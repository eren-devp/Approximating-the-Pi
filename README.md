# Approximating-the-Pi

Tested a logic I saw from The Coding Train and it worked.

Simply if you send random particles to a square and if you draw a circle inside of it, the particles that's inside of the circle's division by all particles multiplied by 4 will give us the pi.

pi * r ^ 2
---------- = pi/4 = insideCircleAmount / allParticles then we reach: **pi = 4 * insideCircleAmount / allParticles**
 4 * r ^ 2
