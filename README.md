# Approximating-the-Pi

Tested a logic I saw from <a href="https://youtu.be/5cNnf_7e92Q?feature=shared">The Coding Train</a>.

To simplify if you send <i>random particles</i> to a <strong>square</strong> and if you draw a <strong>circle</strong> inside of it, the particles that's inside of the circle's division by all particles multiplied by 4 will give us the pi.

<h2>Formula Explained:</h2>
(pi * r ^ 2) / (4 * r ^ 2) = pi/4 = insideCircleAmount / allParticles then we reach:<br>
<strong>pi = 4 * insideCircleAmount / allParticles</strong>
